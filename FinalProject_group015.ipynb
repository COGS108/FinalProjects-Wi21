    "$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$ The general scope of this project encompasses how access to telemedicine in different ethnic groups impacts health in light of covid-19. Throughout our analysis, we look at infections by race & access to telemedicine by race. We were expecting to see correlations with health & race that reflected stereotypical American social conditions; Non-whites would have less access to telemedicine compared to whites. We discovered that participants belonging to historically-disadvantaged ethnic groups sought and received telemedicine care at significantly different rates compared to white participants, but the discrepancy fluctuated throughout the pandemic, most likely due to other variables besides race. \n",

    "\n",
    "$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$ Our data analysis throughout the project was able to shed light on the disparities between the quality of healthcare and a person's ethnicity. By conducting one-way ANOVA tests and utilizing the Tukey HSD Test we were able to compare the early_infection and late_infection dataframes and see that overall, there are some significant differences in access to telemedicine between differing ethnic groups. With further analysis, we were also able to conclude that in all ethnicity groups, telemedicine usage increased over the year of the pandemic."

    "$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$ We were drawn to the concept of analyzing how different groups of people have been affected by COVID-19 in relation to their access to telemedicine and its intersectionality to ethnicity. Analyzing this data is extremely relevant to current events here in the United States, and public health pertains to many of our group members’ preferred tentative areas of study and/or specializations. By deciding to invest in this prompt, this allows us to have a plethora of comprehensive data sets to look for inspiration and pull information from for research and analysis. Having current data will additionally allow us to make the most educated data analysis we can about social and economic factors interaction with the push for more telemedicine. We seek to further our understanding of how the pandemic has affected how different people seek medical care as more and more aspects of our lives transition to remote interaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$ The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a large shift in the healthcare system, especially as people are encouraged to stay inside to avoid contagion and spread. In part, this is a result of fear that hospitals may become overcrowded and no longer able to adequately treat the admitted patients, which is why there has been an increased emphasis on the use of telehealth when possible [1]. Telehealth has been around for over a decade now, and its use has been increasing each year, with 76% of hospitals in the United States using telehealth to some degree in 2017 [4]. In the pandemic, healthcare providers have turned to telehealth as a way to screen patients before they meet in person to only see patients when necessary, and have also utilized telehealth for follow ups increasingly [1]. However, some problems have arisen with telemedicine. For example, virtual meetings and check ins have caused an increase in the amount of appointments that patients have been making, which has flooded the healthcare professionals with an overwhelming amount of requests [1]. Additionally, the disparities in healthcare access have been further highlighted in this pandemic, as those without insurance and technologies to have a virtual platform have not received the same level of service as people who can afford such services [1]. Thus, the use of telemedicine in the pandemic appears to vary, with many factors potentially contributing to this difference. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$ Access to telemedicine is affected by a wide range of factors. For example, as mentioned by Pearlstein, older Americans are the most likely to require regular healthcare, but have the least access to virtual visits due to technological, insurance, and disability barriers. 41% of American covered by Medicare do not own computers or smart-phones with internet access, which greatly limits their ability to seek quality care from the safety of their own homes [2]. With the sudden rise of COVID-19 cases in the US, the previously minimal demand for telemedicine has rapidly increased as healthcare facilities are becoming overwhelmed with patients, and Americans are advised to stay at home as much as possible. Although many states are attempting to expand the availability of telehealth in their Medicaid programs, we simply do not have the economic and political resources to do so as efficiently and widespread as needed, therefore leading to the possibility of many disadvantaged groups being left without healthcare options during a global pandemic [3]. As such, it is important that we closely examine access to telehealth services as it relates to different identity groups that are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$ With the expansion of the use of telehealth, we predict noticeable differences in the accessibility of healthcare amongst groups of different socioeconomic status (SES), racial, and educational backgrounds due to factors such as their insurance status and the growing technological gap, thus affecting their access and quality of healthcare. In particular, when considering racial and ethnic minority groups, some groups are more likely to be uninsured than non-hispanic Whites [5]. Therefore, some individuals are systematically disadvantaged and unable to obtain medical services. In addition to higher rates of uninsurance, health access is limited to ethnicity minority groups due to factors such as lack of transportation, child care, or inability to take time off work; communication and language barriers; and overall historical and current discrimination in healthcare systems [5]. With these factors disproportionately affecting ethnic minority groups, we can expect to see a difference among racial and ethnicity groups in regards to access to health care, especially when factoring in the element of technology during in the age of increasing telemedicine admits the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

Thus, from comparing the two graphs, White non-Hispanic is the group that appears to have increased access the most in terms of percent.\n",

    "$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$Given the nature of this topic, privacy concerns are at the forefront of this project to ensure that patients are not having their information shared without being anonymous. For our two datasets, individual identities were already removed to allow for anonymity. The first dataset had percentages by ethnicity, so no individual values were recorded, but rather a percentage of the entire ethnicity as a whole was represented. This allows for anonymity at the individual level, which we believe values privacy. For our second dataset, we are loking at numbers of individuals, but once again there are no names or identifications attached to the data, only ethnicity and state. We believe that this second dataset maintains privacy as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$We believe that this project is ethical because of the goals to investigate any disparities in telemedicine, and no group will be specifically benefitting or profiting from the results of our project. We will simply be taking our data as is and seeing if our research question and hypothesis are demonstrated in the results. We only removed columns that were not relevant to our study and kept the rows as they were so as to not alter the results. We believe that we are ethical in our goals to simply look at the data, and we believe that the results of our analysis could allow for a better understanding of the experience of different ethnic groups with telemedicine during the pandemic. Since many studies have already outlined differences and inequalities that exist in health care in the United States between various ethnicities, we do not believe that our analysis could be used to specifically harm any ethnic groups as the differences hve already been made clear. Thus, we are not targeting any groups or exposing potential inequalities or vulnerabilities that are not already public.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$In terms of biases for this data, we believe that our first dataset is a representative sample because the data come from the CDC, which give public access and takes information from the entire country based on census understandings of the population. Thus, we believe that this is representative. A potential bias from this data is that the people must be recorded as part of the United States population to be included as a portion of an ethnic group, so people who are not documented citizens may not be represented. However, in general, we believe that there is enough data to be representative overall. For the second dataset, we got the dataset from a professor and we do not know exactly where this professor got the dataset. Thus, there could be biases from how the data were collected. However, this dataset has over 4000 rows of data, so we believe that there is enough data to suggest that this is representative of ethnic groups in states. "

    "$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$Through our statistical analysis we are able to conclude that there are in fact statistical differences in the mean total of telemedicine cases amongst ethnicity groups in both the early and late time period. Our hypothesis had predicted that these discernable differences were possibly due to social conditions surrounding race, therefore we had anticipated a result of White telemedicine cases significantly differing from that of ethnic minorities. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$In the early dataset we were able to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that pairs of ethnicity groups were statistically different within the following comparisons: White and Black Non- Hispanic, White and Hispanic, Hispanic and Other Non-Hispanic, and Black Non-Hispanic and Other Non-Hispanic. For our conclusions we will factor out the category of Other Non-Hispanic individuals due to it’s vague categorization and factoring of many different races, which skews its group numbers and accounts for 38.4% of early telemedicine cases. With this, we can see that White cases (p=30.1%) when compared to Black cases (p=18.0%) and Hispanic cases (p=13.0%) make up nearly twice as much of the dataset’s telemedicine usage. This may be due to factors such as ethnic minorities having less overall access to health care services due to higher uninsurance rates, language and cultural barriers, or technological barriers. However, we see different results when looking at a later, more recent time period.\n",

Again we exclude the data from the Other Non-Hisapnic category for its skewed numbers, which allows it to make up 59.4% of the telemedicine cases. With this we can see that the only statistically different comparisons are between that of White cases (p=40.0%) and Black cases (p=9.0%). Some explanations for the shift in differences among ethnicity groups may be explained by the overall increase in telemedicine cases from the early time period to the late time period. The late_infection dataframe has significantly more telemedicine counts than the early_infection dataframe (19,296,572 > 374,279) which is reasonable as many health care providers switched to a minimal contact delivery of medical services such as telemedicine. The increase of telemedicine usage can also be explained through the expansion of Medicare telehealth during the COVID-19 public health emergency. With this, previously uninsured individuals, including ethnic minorities who may be disproportionately uninsured, could have gained health coverage when compared to the earlier time point. As previously mentioned, we did analyze an overall increase in telemedicine usage across all ethnicity groups, through a series of t-tests which can also be explained by the shift to telemedicine as the primary delivery of healthcare and expansions of government aid.\n",

    "$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$Overall our data did allow us to answer our research question as to whether there were discrepancies between ethnicity groups and whether within each group total cases of telemedicine had increased or decreased during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, our dataset is limited in the conclusions we can make. Although we speculate possible social conditions surrounding race as a factor affecting differences amongst ethnicity groups, we do not have operational definitions to measure and further validate these possible reasons. For example, our datasets did not contain information regarding socioeconomic status such as average household income for ethnicity groups within each state. With this data we would be able to compare these numbers and be able to factor SES into why some ethnicity groups may be more likely to be uninsured than others (e.g. Lesser job stability and therefore no employer-sponsored insurance; inability to cover health service premiums; etc.). Another limitation is that the Other Non-Hispanic categorization factored in many races and skewed the data in comparison to the other ethnicity categories. Races such as Asian, American Indian and Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander vary significantly in predisposed health conditions, employment status and SES and potential social barriers which may affect their access to healthcare.\n",

    "$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$In conclusion, access to telemedicine is a critically important resource during the circumstances of a pandemic, in which making frequent trips to a clinic in search of medical care can prove risky, especially to the immunocompromised and elderly. In addition, different ethnicity groups in the United States have historically received unequal access to healthcare depending on a variety of factors. Our project set to examine whether potential barriers existed between different ethnic groups within the specific framework of telemedicine access during COVID-19. Through our research, we discovered that, in general, participants belonging to historically-disadvantaged ethnic groups sought out and received telemedicine care at significantly different percentages compared to white participants, but the circumstances of this discrepancy changed throughout the course of the pandemic. We may speculate a variety of reasons for why this is; perhaps the expanding of social service programs, increase of total case numbers, differences in infection rates between different ethnic communities all play a factor of some degree. However, what we can clearly identify is that there exists observable imbalances in the overall amount of telemedicine demand/usage that can be studied through the total participants of each ethnic group that actually accessed such services during the course of the pandemic. This points to clear inequalities between standards and needs of care between these groups, and is an important set of statistics to examine for the purpose of establishing, diagnosing, and addressing larger disparities in access to healthcare, social infrastructure, and government services both within the context of a pandemic, as well as outside of one. These are issues that have existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, continue to exist now, and may well extend into the future without proper examination of the true extent of their prevalence. "
