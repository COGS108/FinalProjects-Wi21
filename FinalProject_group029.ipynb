    "Our goal in our project was to see if we can build a classification on our data set from the census bureau database to predict if someone makes more than $50,000 per year. In this dataset, there was a column that said if the individual was making more or less than this income threshold a year, letting us use this data set as both a training set and a test set. With this suitable data set, we transformed most of our categorical data set into numerical data and imported and ran a random forest classifier. In the end, our final classifier had a 79% accuracy on our given dataset, showing us that our classifier is suitable with decent accuracy."

Figuring this out would also help us understand people’s living conditions such as access to resources such as health care, food, housing, education, etc. Furthermore, we can also use this information and observation to find out which communities are affected by poor socioeconomic factors and face discrimination and how badly they affect certain people within that community.\n",

While this article shows us many metrics related to how higher education could lead to an increased salary, the biggest takeaway we had from this article was that graduating with a high school diploma is equivalent to an almost $7,000 increase in annual salary. This is significant because one of the specific variables we analyze is categorized information about education level."

First, for our test data file, we noticed that the first line of the csv was nonsense unrelated to the data, so we had to manually remove it and create a new file to read in. Secondly, the csv was formatted differently than pandas expects through the read_csv() function (the data had spaces after each comma), so we had to specify a new delimeter. Third, we used the data dictionary attached to these datasets to rename to columns with more informative names. Lastly, we found the value in our dataset that corresponded to a missing entry, and dropped those values (we dropped them instead of trying to replace them since they are categorical, which means sampling or imputation likely won't work).\n",

After finding a dataset that incorporated census data that could help us answer this question, we did some background research to familiarize ourselves with the topic. After performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and model assessment on the census data set, we’ve developed a model that can predict whether or not an individual makes $50,000 with about an 80% accuracy. \n",

    "This project is significant because we’ve proven that various socio-economic factors do have an impact on income, and have developed a model to do this prediction. However, there are some limitations of our project that relate to its scope. The analysis we performed only applies to the United States, since the source of our data is from the US Census Bureau. Another limitation of this project is that our model isn’t tuned as well as it could be. We could have tested even more models on our dataset, and tried tuning the various hyperparameters each model has to produce a better model accuracy.\n",

    "In terms of how this project can impact society, we can use the work we’ve done through this analysis to address points that were outlined in our background section. Some of these applications include using this analysis to analyze access to healthcare, food, and housing based on income, or finding if certain racial, ethnic, or social groups disproportionately display poor socioeconomic (and in turn, income) situations, and if any systemic issues are the cause for this.\n"
